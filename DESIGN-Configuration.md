<p align = "justify"><b>Objective:</b> Design a Power Converter and Integrate it with PV Module, finally check its performance using (i) Ä†uk Converter, and (ii) SEPIC Converter. However, before designing the performance and efficiency of a PV Module is checked with Buck-Boost Converter and the results are compared.</p>

## PV Module
<p align = "justify">PV Array in Simulink has many in-built pre-developed module configured, one such is the <a href = "http://www.solarhub.com/product-catalog/pv-modules/5623-1STH-215-P-1Soltech">1Soltech - 1STH-215-P</a>. Here, this module has been used. Some basic electrical properties is as follows:</p>

| | Value |
| :--- | ---: |
| Max. Power ($P_{max}$) | 213.13 W |
| Open Circuit Voltage ($V_{oc}$) | 36.3 V |
| Sc. Current ($I_{sc}$) | 7.84 A |
| Max. Voltage @MPP ($V_{mp}$) | 29 V |
| Max. Current@MPP ($I_{mp}$) | 7.35 A |
